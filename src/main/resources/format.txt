Craftable things:
- Ore Refinery (may need to be custom UI)
  + Slag
  + Purified Ore Chunk [best]
  + Impure Ore Chunk [can be refined]
  + Unstable Ore Chunk [can't be refined, may explode prematurely]

- Biodiesel Reactor [water+plants+meat] (may need to be custom UI)
  + Waste Water
  + Biofuel

- Warhead (may need to have a crafting system with custom UI)
  + An amount of Ore Chunks

- Targeting Computer

- Launch Station

Mix a custom amount of Biodiesel, a targeting computer, and one Warhead to create a Rocket (can be good, unstable, or faulty)
Connect the rocket to a Launch Station to determine a target. If no computer is added, or if they are not connected, the rocket can go off on a random nearby target.

Place a rocket item down to auto-build a schematic (if enough room)

Fuel added determines how far it can fly from placement location

Use a Launch Station to prime the rocket. Can also disarm, self-destruct. Determine/change target before launch.

Timer before rocket lands. Can receive some operations during this time.



Support environmental interactions. If rockets/fuel/chunks/etc are used in traditional ways (furnace, burned, etc.),
blow things up.
